My name is Minh.

I'm into web development, crypto currency, travel, and having a good time :).
This is the place where I keep my notes and thoughts about the 'stuff' that I have been doing.
Doing this is going to be beneficial to my future self because I normally have them 'How the f*** did I do that?' moments.
Hopefully though, these notes will also be of some use for you guys out there.

I will see you all later :)
